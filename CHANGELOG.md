# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- First public release of the AppDiscovery React Native SDK (Android and iOS).
- `AppDiscovery.init({ host, appId, sdkKey, playerId, trackerHost })`: the offerwall host is a required setting, there is no default. An invalid host rejects with an `Error`.
- `AppDiscovery.create(host, appId, sdkKey, playerId, trackerHost?)` returns an `OfferwallInstance` with `show()`, `onReward` and `onClose`, like the native `AppDiscovery.create`.
- `AppDiscovery.showOfferwall`, `setUserId`, `onReward` / `onClose` listeners and `removeAllListeners`.
- `AppDiscovery.syncPendingRewards` delivers rewards earned while the app was closed.
- Native module `AppDiscoveryModule`; builds on the AppDiscovery Android SDK 1.0.0 (JitPack) and the AppDiscovery iOS SDK 1.0.0 (xcframework, vendored).
